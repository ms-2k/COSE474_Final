todo:
    test more models
    finish up web scraper
    integrate paraphraser with web scraper
    begin writing report

data collection plan:
    acquire article
    create thread and launch python instance
    load a model into python instance
    send article to python instance
    paraphrase it with selected model
    await response from worker thread
    main thread acquires another article in the meantime

T5 is not very good at paraphrasing korean
    fine tune maybe?
        this will be a whole project on its own
    realistically trying other models will work better
    tons of models already fine tuned to KR corpus on hugging face

openchat is pretty amazing despite not being fine tuned to korean
    might be better to use its prebuit API server instead though
    vanilla transformers is kinda laggy
        10 whole minutes to paraphrase an article
        maybe quantization issue?
        loading in 4bit causes issues
    could just make the scraper make API calls to local openchat client
    maybe extend it to make API calls to ChatGPT as well
