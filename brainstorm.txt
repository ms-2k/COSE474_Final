todo:
    test more models
    finish up web scraper
    integrate paraphraser with web scraper
    begin writing report

data collection plan:
    acquire article
    create thread and launch python instance
    load a model into python instance
    send article to python instance
    paraphrase it with selected model
    await response from worker thread
    main thread acquires another article in the meantime

T5 is not very good at paraphrasing korean
    fine tune maybe?
    ^will be a whole project on its own
realistically trying other models will work better
tons of models already fine tuned to KR corpus on hugging face
